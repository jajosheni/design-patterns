**Memento Design Pattern**

The subject of the Memento design pattern example implements the "undo" method of a program that writes the article.
This program keeps the article contents in a class called Article.

ArticleMemento class stores the contents of the Article class for further use.
This class is our memento class in the design pattern.

ArticleCreator class holds the list of ArticleMemento objects containing articles.

Whenever a new article item content comes to this class,
one memento object is linked to the content created and this object is added to the list of memento objects.

The undo procedure in this class pulls the memento object that holds the latest article content in the list
and sets the article content as the content inside this memento object.

If we run the member class we add the contents of "Politics", "Literature", "Science" and "Sports".
Then after the undo function is run three times the content of the article becomes "Politics".

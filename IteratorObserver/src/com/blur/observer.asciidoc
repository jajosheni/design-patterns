**Observer Design Pattern**

In this project, the observer prints an alert when an article or comment is added.

The Comment and Article classes are derived from the Observer interface class.
When the notify method in these classes is called, the notify method works in the comments and article classes.

The observable class in the Observer design pattern determines what is observed.
The class observed in this project is named NotifyObservable.
In this class a list containing observers is saved.

There is an addObserver method that can add to this list,
a removeObserver to delete from the list and
a notifyObservable method to announce to the observers.

This method calls the notifyObservable method of all observers in the list,
allowing them to be aware of the change and take action accordingly.

**Builder Design Pattern**

With this design pattern, we can create an object step by step with its different features.

The object to be created in this project is the User object.
The constructor of the user class is the class named UserBuilder.
The User constructor enables the step-by-step installation of the object and gains
new data with the methods of "name", "email", "celNo", "nickname", "gender".
